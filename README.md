Application was created using the Tkinter module. Further changes are possible.

The application consists of two tabs:
1. Scientific Calculator: Performs regular arithmetic operations.
2. Graph Plotter: Generates various types of plots, including 2D and 3D graphs.

To use the graph plotter:
- Enter the formula for the function you want to plot in the left panel (e.g., sin(x^2)).
- Specify the variables used in the function (e.g., x).
- Optionally, specify the boundaries for the variables' axes.
- If no boundaries are specified, the chart will be plotted within the default range of [-1, 1].

WARNINGS:
- Lines 22 and 27 of *Frame2.py* may require adjustments to the padx parameter.

These potential issues will be addressed in future updates.
